## My process

  

### Built with

  

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- CSS custom properties

- Flexbox


### What I learned

I wanted to get back into web development and thought of starting with a challenge with easy difficulty.

This project helped me to brush up my concepts on Flexbox layout and styling using CSS.
  

### Continued development

I would further like to do some complex project, with some new frameworks, to further improve my understanding and learning.
